description: A 2006 NASA study reveals that the Earth has been warming approximately
  0.2 degrees Celsius (.36 Fahrenheit) per decade for the past 30 years. This rapid
  warming has brought global temperature to within about one degree Celsius 1.8 Degrees
  Fahrenheit) of the maximum estimated temperature during the past million years.
