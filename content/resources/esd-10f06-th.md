  caption: A 2006 [NASA study](http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/environment/world_warmth.html)
    reveals that the Earth has been warming approximately 0.2 degrees Celsius (.36
    Fahrenheit) per decade for the past 30 years. This rapid warming has brought global
    temperature to within about one degree Celsius 1.8 Degrees Fahrenheit) of the
    maximum estimated temperature during the past million years. (Image courtesy of
